# Git and Github 

Git is a version-control software.
There are tons of material available online to know about Git and Github.  
Some of them are listed below.


Git is one of the most widely used tools in programming, so it would definitely be helpful in knowing how to use
it.  

> At first, if the concepts of Git feel difficult/intimidating, know that it is completely fine to be so.
Everyone has been there once. Don't let it de-motivate you. 
You don't have to fully understand/ know everything in a single day.

Suggested resources for learning Git: 

- [Git and Git for poets](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZF9C0YMKuns9sLDzK6zoiV) - A YouTube playlist
    This is one of the easy to follow and quite interesting tutorial video series about Git and GitHub.
    (you may skip the part about GitHub Pages for now if you want)


- [Git-It](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron) - An interactive Desktop app for learning Git.  <br>
    For those of you who like to go in a practical route, this would be a great option.  
    This desktop application takes you over the concepts of Git while allowing you to try out the concepts practically.
    The [README file](https://github.com/jlord/git-it-electron#what-to-install) has instructions for installing
    and using it.
  

After going through the above links, you should now have a GitHub account, and know the basics of working with Git and  have Git set up and installed on your computers.
